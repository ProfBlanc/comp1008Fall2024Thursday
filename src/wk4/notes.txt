ArrayList
    like an array
        dynamic: NOT fixes size
    Syntax
        ArrayList<data_type> nameOfVar = new ArrayList<>();

    data_type
        reference data type
            int => Integer
            primitive => capitalize first letter
                byte    =>  Byte
                double  =>  Double

    use methods for all operation
        add     .add(object value)
        remove  .remove(int index)
                .remove (object value)
        get     .get()
        insert  .add(int index, object value)
        set     .set(int index, object new_value)


Class:
    a blueprint, template using to product an object/thing

    class two major components
        A: attributes aka characteristics aka look
        A: actions aka behaviours aka what it does

        Attributes: values that are customizable/differ from object to object
                    variables
                    states or status

                    variables in a class  => instance variables

        object = copy of the blueprint aka instance of blueprint

        Actions: methods aka functions that describe what instance does
                 evaluate one or many attributes

    accessibility
        public          anyone from anywhere has access (can see it)
        protected       only accessibily inside same package
        private         only available inside the class
                        why private? enforce restrictions


Getter and Setter
    give access to an attribute that is otherwise inaccessible
    private: NEED getter and setter
    protected: Strongly consider getter and setter

    special method
        getInstanceVarName()
        setInstanceVarName(newValue)
